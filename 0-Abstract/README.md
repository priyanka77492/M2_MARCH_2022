Project title : Servo movement using atmega328 
servos have a limited range of rotation, usually half way around a circle (180 degrees).
A servo can be told at what angle to turn to so movements can be controlled by the user.
A servo with an electronic servo controller is great for moving things in a very controlled fashion.
