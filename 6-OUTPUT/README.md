Servo motors are small in size, and because they have built-in circuitry to control their movement, they can be connected directly to an Arduino.
In this experiment, we will connect the power and ground pins directly to the Arduino 5V and GND pins. The PWM input will be connected to one of the Arduino's digital output pins.
